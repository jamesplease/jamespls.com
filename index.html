  Hi, Iâ€™m James Smith. I work at <a href='https://www.bocoup.com/' target='_blank'>Bocoup</a> on projects for the web,
  splitting my time between our consulting and education initiatives. As a consultant, I practice design, user experience,
  and development. As an educator, I develop curriculum and give classes and workshops.
</p>
<p>
  Outside of work, I jump between projects spanning a range of interests, including physics, mathematics, philosophy,
  personal finance, illustration, game development, and napping.
