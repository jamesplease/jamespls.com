  Hi, I’m James Smith. I work at <a href='https://www.bocoup.com/' target='_blank'>Bocoup</a> on variety of projects that revolve
  around web applications. I'm involved in our education, design, user experience, and development initiatives.
</p>
<p>
  When I’m not at work, I jump between projects spanning a range of interests,
  including physics, mathematics, philosophy, personal finance, illustration, game
  development, and napping.
